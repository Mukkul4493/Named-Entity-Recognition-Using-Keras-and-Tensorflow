# Named-Entity-Recognition-Using-Keras-and-Tensorflow

We will use Keras with Tensorflow as backend to create an LSTM Neural Network model and train it to recognize entities in text data

Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc

Dataset is found on Kaggle, Highly cited and used to evaluate various NER models.
